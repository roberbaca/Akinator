# Akinator

This prototype was made in C++ trying to emulate the famous game Akinator. During gameplay, it attempts to determine what fictional or real-life character, object, film, television show, or animal the player is thinking of by asking a series of questions.

You have to enter the questions first. Then another user can start guessing.
